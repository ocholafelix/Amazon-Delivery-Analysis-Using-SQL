 # 📦 Amazon Delivery Analysis Using SQL

This project presents a data-driven analysis of Amazon delivery performance using SQL. The goal was to uncover key insights that can help improve delivery efficiency, understand regional delivery behavior, and support business decisions.

## 📊 Project Objectives

- Understand delivery trends and patterns
- Identify regions with the highest and lowest delivery volumes
- Analyze average delivery times across different locations
- Spot outliers and inconsistencies in delivery durations
- Recommend actionable insights to improve logistics and customer satisfaction

## 🗂️ Dataset Overview

The dataset includes:
- Order IDs
- Delivery status (On-time, Late, etc.)
- Delivery and order dates
- Customer location data (city, state)
- Delivery duration in days

> 📌 **Note**: Dataset used is for demonstration and educational purposes.

## 🧠 Key Questions Explored

- What is the average delivery time across regions?
- Which regions have the most late deliveries?
- Are there patterns in late deliveries by day or time?
- Which states show the best on-time performance?
- What recommendations can improve the delivery process?

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **SQL** – PostgreSQL was used for querying, aggregating, and analyzing the data
- **DB Tools** – pgAdmin / DBeaver (or your preferred IDE)
- **Excel** – Initial data cleanup (if applicable)
- **Wix Blog** – Final insights published online

## 📈 Key Insights

- 🟢 Most deliveries were completed within 3–5 business days.
- 🔴 Certain states showed higher frequencies of late deliveries (details in analysis).
- 📍 Geographic trends indicated urban areas had more efficient delivery systems.
- 📉 Recommendations included improving logistics in underperforming zones and forecasting delays during peak times.
